# COVID-19 Deaths in Nursing Homes
A personal project (WIP) to develop an interface that allows a user to query a database to find the number of COVID-19 deaths in a nursing home, based off of data collected by journalist Nora Loreto.
Data used is provided in csv form in 'data' folder, and must be moved to mysql uploads directory (as specified in code) in order to run.
SQL required to set up the database is provided, commented out, in the code. To run, uncomment each line (one by one) and run the code. This will set up the database.
